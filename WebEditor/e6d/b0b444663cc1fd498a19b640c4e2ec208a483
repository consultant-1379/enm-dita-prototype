      <p>When downtime is required for a procedure described in this guide, it means that no user
         requests can be allowed while the procedure is being implemented. This requires shutting
         down all traffic to the <ph keyref="ECM_short"/> nodes.</p>
      <p>In a Geo-Redundant deployment, this can be done by disabling traffic at the F5 node in the
         active site. Alternatively, traffic can be disabled at some upstream point in the network
         (for example, at the DNS server).</p>
