      <p>The <ph keyref=""/> Probe is used to analyze traffic in mobile telecommunication networks. Data collection is done by passive monitoring of traffic on the network interfaces. The following 3GPP interfaces are supported:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
                                    <p>2G and 3G Packet Core network Gn and Gp interface.</p>
                                    <p>Supported protocols: GTPCv1 control plane and GTPU user plane (including 3GDT).</p>
                                 </li>
         <li>
                                    <p>4G Evolved Packet Core network S11, S5, S8, S1-U, Sv, S2b, and S2a interfaces.</p>
                                    <p>Supported protocols: GTPCv2 control plane and GTPU user plane.</p>
                                    <p>4G EPC with New Radio is also supported (5G Option 3/3a/3x).</p>
                                    <p>IMS core network Mw interface.</p>
                                    <p>Supported protocols: SIP.</p>
                                 </li>
      </ul>
      <p>The <ph keyref=""/> Probe performs the following data processing:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
                                    <p>Analyzes control plane traffic, writes PDP and PDN signaling events.</p>
                                 </li>
         <li>
                                    <p>Analyzes user plane traffic, calculates detailed performance metrics of several supported applications (for example: TCP throughput, Web browsing speed, Video freeze rate).</p>
                                 </li>
         <li>
                                    <p>Analyzes user plane traffic, performs traffic classification (traffic volume of many supported applications).</p>
                                 </li>
         <li>
                                    <p>Analyzes IMS SIP signaling: Registration, Session setup, Session termination.</p>
                                 </li>
      </ul>
      <p>EEA GTP Probes also work in networks where Control and User Plane functions are separated (CUPS).</p>

         <p>Control and User Plane Separation support is a restricted feature and is turned off by default. Consult Ericsson personnel for more information.</p>

      <p>The <ph keyref=""/> Probe handles codec information, which is available from the following sources:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
                                    <p>
                                       <ph importance="normal">Codec identification from SIP signaling:</ph> Any kind of codec is supported from SIP signaling. The codec type can be copied.</p>
                                 </li>
         <li>
                                    <p>
                                       <ph importance="normal">Codec identification from RTP media analysis:</ph> The RTP Probe has no additional information other than the binary media package. Identification of the (fixed length) AMR packages is solved, and the RTP probe supports all AMR-NB and AMR-WB codec modes and differentiates between various EVS bitrates, but cannot distinguish between EVS-NB/WB/SWB, hence the list of supported codecs and modes below has only one row for EVS:</p>
