      <p>The <ph keyref="ActiveMQ_s"/>
         <filepath>admin</filepath> ID is used for administrative purposes when managing queues.
         Changing this password includes multiple steps, such as changing the password in several
         files, changing the password in the Orchestration component, and stopping and restarting
         several processes.</p>

                              <p>This ID requires special considerations for geo-redundant
               deployments since it requires certain processes to be active. Once <ph keyref="GR_l"/> is configured, certain processes become inactive on the standby site. Consider the
               following:</p>
                              <ul>
               <li>
                                 <p>This procedure must be performed only on the active site.</p>
                              </li>
               <li>
                                 <p>It is recommended to change this password <ph importance="low">before</ph>
                     <ph keyref="GR_l"/> is configured because all required processes are active on
                     both <ph keyref="HA_s"/> nodes at this time. Once <ph keyref="GR_l"/> is
                     configured, certain processes become inactive on the standby site. </p>
                              </li>
               <li>
                                 <p>Once <ph keyref="GR_l"/> has been configured, you must failover
                     to the standby site, which makes it the new active site, to change the
                     password. For this reason, it is highly recommended to schedule password
                     changes for this ID during a scheduled maintenance period.</p>
