      <p>To manually audit the number of subscribers processed in <ph keyref=""/>, use
         the <filepath>health_check</filepath> script which can be found at
            <filepath>/opt/ericsson/eea/tools/health_check</filepath>.</p>
      <note id="note_N1005E_N1004B_N10001">
                           <p>Start the Healthcheck service on only one Correlator host of the
            cluster. The <parmname>Nr of subscribers</parmname> output value corresponds with the
            number of distinct IMSIs seen by the correlation layer, since <ph keyref=""/>
            Correlator was last started.</p>
                        </note>
      <p>The script provides information about the Correlator cluster state. The latest status of
         the cluster can be retrieved by running the script without parameters. Its logfile collects
         the cluster status information in every running period (10 seconds), thus the status of the
         cluster can be investigated for a longer time period by checking the log at
            <filepath>/data/eea_log/health_check.log</filepath>.</p>
      <p>Mapping ratios measure the mapping efficiency of the Correlator mapping layer. In general, the mapping ratio shows the percentage of mapped events of the corresponding source, the rest of the events are dropped. If the mapping ratio is 0%, it does not necessarily mean that all of the corresponding events are dropped, it can also mean that there is no related source configured. The different mapping ratios are described below:</p>
      <ul>
         <li>
                              <p>4G RAN mapping ratio</p>
                              <p>Events coming from CTR sources do not contain IMSI. Correlator tries to map them to users or IMSIs based on information gathered from other sources. This mapping ratio indicates the percentage of successful mapping.</p>
                           </li>
         <li>
                              <p>VSK RTP mapping ratio</p>
                              <p>Not used yet.</p>
                           </li>
         <li>
                              <p>IMS and CDR mapping ratio</p>
            <p>This value shows the successful MSISDN to IMSI mapping ratio. MSISDN is available in
               SIP and CDR events, and in certain SGSN-MME events.</p>
                           </li>
         <li>
            <p>GTP-U CUPS mapping ratio</p>
            <p>In case of CUPS mode, events coming from GTP-U Probes do not contain IMSI. The
               Correlator tries to map them to users or IMSIs based on GTP-C information. The
               mapping ratio indicates the percentage of successful mapping. Events without
               successful mapping are dropped.</p>
            <note id="note_N100AC_N100A9_N100A2_N1007B_N1004B_N10001" otherprops="CUPS_limited">
               <p>Control and User Plane Separation support is a restricted feature and is turned

            </note>
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>SGW and PGW mapping ratio</p>
            <p>In case of CUPS mode, events coming from GTP-C Probes do not contain IMSI except for
               the PDP or PDN Create Session messages. The Correlator tries to map them to users or
               IMSIs based on GTP-C information. The mapping ratio indicates the percentage of
               successful mapping. Events without successful mapping are dropped.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Exact threshold for the mapping values cannot be defined, as it depends on many factors. In general it is suggested to monitor the system when it is considered healthy and note the mapping ratio numbers. If later, for some reason any of the mapping ratios goes significantly below those numbers, corrective actions are to be trigged (for example, check affected sources).</p>
